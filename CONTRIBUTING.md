Policy: Automated Test Suite for New Functionality

As major new functionality is added to the software produced by this project,
corresponding tests for that functionality must be created and added to the
automated test suite. This ensures that the new features are thoroughly
validated and that their integration does not introduce regressions or
unexpected behavior in the existing system.

Key Points:
- Every new feature or significant change must include automated tests.
- Tests should cover both expected behavior and edge cases.
- The automated test suite should be run regularly to maintain software quality.
- Developers are responsible for ensuring that their contributions pass all
    existing and newly added tests before merging into the main codebase.
